# Cosmos Library
Main required library for The Cosmos Series mods. Currently using Forge for MinecraftForge 1.20.1.

### Description
Cosmos Library is a collection of helper functions to enable a quicker and more seamless creation of Minecraft Mods. It adds nothing to the game itself, it is simply a base upon which other mods are created. This also allows the reduction of common code distributed within other mods, as that common code is stored in this mod once.

This library is required for all mods in **The Cosmos Series**.

## Developers
A note for any Developers looking to use Cosmos Library for their own projects:

_Cosmos Library is made and used exclusively by TheCosmicNebula for The Cosmos Series. There is no official documentation, and there likely will never be. TheCosmicNebula will ruthlessly change or remove functions and classes with reckless abandon._

_It is not recommended to use this library due to the high frequency of updates which will break compatibility. The source code is not kept up to date and updates are not broadcast outside of the changelog._

If you are still in need of a library to use, I would suggest looking for one with thorough documentation, and a discord server which announces changes. Or make your own.
